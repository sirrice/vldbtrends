	<h1 >What's hot in databases? (updated for 1975 to 2013!)</h1>
	
	<p >
		Trending topics in VLDB, via key words in the titles of publications from 1975 to 2013.
  <p>
		I did a quick and dirty job of removing stop words and
		stemming.  If you want, you can also <a
		href="./stats.db">download the sqlite database</a> with all of
  the data.  Last year's analysis and commentary is at <a href="./vldb2012.html">vldb2012.html</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
  Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/samrmadden">@samrmadden</a> for the 2000 - 2011 titles.<br/>
  Thansk to DBLP for the rest!

	<h1>Trends across all time</h1>
    <p>
        Thees trends are based on the keywords across all
        years (1975 - now) of VLDB publications
    </p>
    <h2>Most Stable</h2>
    <p>
    As we would expect, the most consistently popular keywords are all tightly
    related to our expertise as a community.  <b>databases, indexes, joins,
    models, and management</b> are all at the core of what we do.
    </p>
    <div class="row">%s</div>

    <h2>What's hot?</h2>
    <p>
    Here, we look for keywords that have an overall upward trend.
    <p>
    It's interesting that <b>queries, indices, and efficiency</b> are 
    new in the past two decades.  We can also see the <b>web</b> burst onto 
    the scene, bringing <b>search</b> along with it.  We see the
    excitement, then decline of <b>streaming</b>.  <b>Distributed</b>
    processing is on the rise in parallel with "big data".

    </p>
    <div class="row">%s</div>


  <h2>What's not?</h2>
    <p>
    On the long time scale, <b>database, models and relational</b> as keywords are dying!  
    <p>We can see that <b>object oriented, rules, activity</b> came 
    and went.  We always talk about <b>XML</b> being dead, at it sure looks that way on paper, along with <b>streams, services, and caching</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="row">%s</div>

	<h1>The New Hotness</h1>
	
    <p>
        Let's now look at keywords that have burst into the scene in
        since I started graduate school (2007). 
        These keywords are selected by computing
        the ratio of "the average number of times a keyword is used
        since 2010" by "the average before 2010".  
    </p>

    <p> 
    <b>Mapreduce, scaling, and the cloud</b> are still at the
    peak of the gartner hype cycle, and there are so many systems that
    it's hard to even compare them.   
    <p>
    Web data is inherently <b>uncertain</b> so we need <b>probabilitc</b>
    techniques to <b>search for similar</b> data.

    <p> Finally it's nice to see that <b>crowdsourcing</b>
    is <i>still</i> trending upwards.
    Perhaps work with a more human and <b>social</b> 
    angle is ready for the lime light.researchers always love <b>hybrid</b> 
    solutions. 

    </p>

<h1>Top topics by year</h1>

<p>
	It's good to see that <b>data</b>, <b>query</b> and <b>databases</b> are never far from our minds.

<h1>How is Eugene's career looking</h1>

<p>
The topics I've decided to work on look like a mixed bag.  <b>Provenance or lineage</b>
seems to be down, but I believe in second chances.  Good to know
that <b>data analysis and workload driven research</b> 
is a stable and increasingly topic!
